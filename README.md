## NEW CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution (CIEE) and the Scientific Collaboration course for the Living Data project seek proposals for new Working Groups to be staged over the 12-month period from March 2022 to February 2023. The deadline for submission is **November 15 2022, midnight PDT**. Proposals should outline a plan to address significant questions in ecology and/or evolution through synthesis-based research in the form of (a) unified and comprehensive data aggregation, (b) methodological integration, (c) conceptual synthesis, (d) analysis of information from multiple sources (e.g., meta-analysis) or of multiple types (e.g. cross-disciplinary integration), or (e) application of compiled research data to environmental problems. CIEE supports projects in any area of ecology and evolution which address questions of high conceptual or applied (including environmental issues) importance. Applicants must define the project scope, meeting agenda, EDI considerations, and plan for publication and authorship. CIEE provides logistic support and travel and meeting expenses.
 
## Application Procedures

The application should be completed with the following information:

**1.** The project title, name and complete contact information for the organizer(s), and project summary (max. 300 words), suitable for public circulation.

**2.** A list of participants, with affiliations and a short (one paragraph) biographic profile including description of their expertise contributed to the working group. Productive working groups typically include participants from a variety of career stages, including early career researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows) as well as mid to later-career researchers (e.g. university faculty, government research scientists, senior managers). CIEE is a national organization, and therefore encourages geographic breadth of the Canadian participants. There is strong evidence for the positive impact of institutional and demographic diversity on the productivity of working groups (Hampton and Parker 2011, Campbell et al. 2013, Crowston et al. 2015). Finally, please distinguish between those who have committed to the project and those who are potential participants.

**3.** A maximum three-pages, single-spaced proposal. Please note that proposals longer than 3 pages will not be accepted. The proposal should include:

**3.1** Brief introduction to the project goals.

**3.2.** Work plan of activities: schedule of pre-meeting activities, agenda of the planned meetings, follow-up plan in order to reach the expected outcomes. As appropriate, please include the source of the data to be synthesized and methods of the analyses. Meetings can be held at any location in Canada; however, preference will be given to meetings hosted at CIEE member organizations. Our experience indicates that a virtual meeting (e.g., via teleconference or Skype) prior to the first physical meeting helps in achieving working group goals (Hampton et al. 2017). In addition, making real progress typically requires at least four full days of meeting time.

**3.3.** Expected outcomes (e.g., publications, white papers, open access databases, etc).

**3.4.** Importance to Canada (e.g., benefit to Canadian environmental and economic well-being).

**4.** A maximum 1-page supplement that addresses EDI considerations and a plan for authorship for any manuscripts that are generated from the working group. In this supplement, please clearly identify the steps that will be taken to ensure broad representation and participation by diverse groups (e.g. include a plan for development of a code of conduct). Authorship considerations should explicitly state how authorship on manuscripts will be determined.
 

## Selection Process

In general, scientific excellence and likelihood of success are the main criteria for evaluation, although consideration will also be given to the benefits to Canada, participant complementarity and diversity, and benefits to CIEE member institutions. The specific criteria of evaluation are:

1. Project rationale: scientific and/or applied significance of the questions, likelihood to advance understanding in ecology, evolution and/or environmental issues, evidence of novel synthesis, and evidence of benefit to Canadian environmental and economic well-being.
2. Project description: clarity of objectives, outcomes, work plan, meeting schedule.
3. Expertise and appropriateness of applicants and participants (from the organizerâ€™s resume and the summaries of the participants). Participant diversity, including the criteria of career, geographic, and demographic diversity.
4. Anticipated outcomes. Potential for defined scientific products, including refereed publications, white papers and open access databases.
5. EDI is addressed in the group composition, as well as actions taken to encourage good EDI practices in group dynamics. Authorship of manuscripts emerging from the working group is laid out.
