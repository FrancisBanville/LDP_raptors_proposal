## Project title

Working title: _Monitoring and predicting the responses of Hawks to environmental changes in the Canadian prairies as an indicator for ecosystem health_

Project summary: 

Due to the expansion of hunting, agriculture, and animal husbandry, the Canadian prairies have undergone immense changes since European colonization. The impacts of such changes on natural prairie systems are poorly understood, and different sectors may implement distinct management practices, impeding collective progress. However, successfully managing and maximizing ecosystem health will have important economic, social, and cultural benefits. This necessitates an effort to monitor ecosystem health in the Canadian prairies at a broad scale and in a standardized way.

Members of the genus _Buteo_ (colloquially called Hawks) are birds of prey, also known as raptors. Numerous species are found across North America, and three (the Red-tailed hawk, Swanson's hawk, and the Ferruginous hawk) breed in the Canadian prairies. It has been established that the ecologies of these species can serve as practical and effective indicators of overall ecosystem health.

In this working group, we aim to combine the expertise of several students, early-career researchers, and non-academic partners, to analyze and model _Buteo_ responses to environmental alterations in the Canadian prairies. The ecosystem changes that raptors face in the prairies are multi-faceted, and understanding their responses to such changes will require collaboration between people with different backgrounds, specializations, and perspectives. As such, we have invited experts in ecological modelling, diverse aspects of _Buteo_ biology, biodiversity, population ecology, bioinformatics, and data science. Over a one-week period in May 2023, this team will analyze existing data on raptors in the prairies, then model raptor distribution and abundance responses to anticipated ecosystem changes. Expected outcomes include both open-science journal publications and non-academic reports, aimed at industry and government partners. This meeting will take place within the environment of interest, at the University of Regina's Cypress Hills Field Station, and has been designed to maximize equitable and inclusive participation and contribution.
