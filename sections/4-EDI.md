A maximum 1-page supplement that addresses EDI considerations and a plan for authorship for any manuscripts that are generated from the working group. In this supplement, please clearly identify the steps that will be taken to ensure broad representation and participation by diverse groups (e.g. include a plan for development of a code of conduct). Authorship considerations should explicitly state how authorship on manuscripts will be determined.
