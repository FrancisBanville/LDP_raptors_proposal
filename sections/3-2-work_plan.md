Work plan of activities: schedule of pre-meeting activities, agenda of the planned meetings, follow-up plan in order to reach the expected outcomes. As appropriate, please include the source of the data to be synthesized and methods of the analyses. Meetings can be held at any location in Canada; however, preference will be given to meetings hosted at CIEE member organizations. Our experience indicates that a virtual meeting (e.g., via teleconference or Skype) prior to the first physical meeting helps in achieving working group goals. In addition, making real progress typically requires at least four full days of meeting time.

---------

The working group sessions will take place at the University of Regina's Field Station, located in the Center Block of Cypress Hills Inter-Provincial Park. This location was chosen for its centrality within Canada and presence within the ecosystem of interest: the Canadian prairies. Meetings will take place over May 8-12th, 2023; pre-meeting materials and logistical information will be circulated to all participants in early March, 2023, and a pre-session meeting with all participants will be scheduled the week of April 3rd-7th. 

**Pre-meeting materials and activities**

In early 2023, the organizers will collect and tidy all database components. Over January and February 2023, organizers will select pre-meeting readings to be circulated to all participants in March, and plan/develop the introductory presentation and meeting taking place in early April. In this introductory gathering, to be held over Zoom or an equivalent virtual conferencing platform, organizers will provide a general introduction to themselves and the project, share the daily schedule for the upcoming Working Group meetings, and communicate any actions that participants must take prior to the in-person meeting. Participants will be asked to develop a short (~15 minute) introductory presentation to themselves and their work, to be shared on the first day of the upcoming meeting.

**Daily schedule and meeting agendas**

_Monday, May 8th, 2023_

Working group participants will present short talks and field questions in the morning. The organizers will end the morning session with a joint presentation, reviewing the topic and goals of the working group. A code of conduct will be established, fostering an equitable and inclusive environment for the working group. This will include a discussion on how data coming from underrepresented areas and collaborators will be handled .
In the afternoon, 2–3-person breakout groups will be formed, and each will address the question of “How we can predict raptor responses to climate change in the prairies and their responses to ecosystem restoration?”. After reviewing ideas and establishing a plan, teams will be formed to focus on specific tasks over the coming days.

_Tuesday, May 9th, 2023_

Each group will first work on their assigned tasks, then present their progress. The participants will discuss following each presentation, and groups will collect diverse feedback, then draft a final proposal and work plan for their respective tasks.

_Wednesday, May 10th, 2023_

The working groups will work further on their tasks and present their progress during the morning. Following discussion, each group will receive targeted feedback, then have time to amalgamate ideas and identify final missing pieces. In the afternoon, after 2.5 days of intense work, all participants will be invited to an afternoon retreat, where the group will head to the field and see some raptors.

_Thursday, May 11th, 2023_

Larger breakout groups will be formed (~5 individuals per group) in the morning, and leadership roles will be established in each. These breakout groups will be targeted at i) formal data analysis and presentation, ii) academic communications planning, iii) non-academic communications planning. In the afternoon, the original breakout groups will be reformed, and each will work at their remaining tasks (established on Wednesday).   

_Friday, May 12th, 2023_

All final progress will be presented. Plans for academic and non-academic communications will be shared, along with an outline for remaining formal data analysis and presentation. Future directions for the working group will be established, including a detailed schedule with follow-up meetings, aimed at achieving remaining outcomes.
