Work plan of activities: schedule of pre-meeting activities, agenda of the planned meetings, follow-up plan in order to reach the expected outcomes. As appropriate, please include the source of the data to be synthesized and methods of the analyses. Meetings can be held at any location in Canada; however, preference will be given to meetings hosted at CIEE member organizations. Our experience indicates that a virtual meeting (e.g., via teleconference or Skype) prior to the first physical meeting helps in achieving working group goals. In addition, making real progress typically requires at least four full days of meeting time.
