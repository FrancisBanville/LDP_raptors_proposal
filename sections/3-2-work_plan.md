Work plan of activities: schedule of pre-meeting activities, agenda of the planned meetings, follow-up plan in order to reach the expected outcomes. As appropriate, please include the source of the data to be synthesized and methods of the analyses. Meetings can be held at any location in Canada; however, preference will be given to meetings hosted at CIEE member organizations. Our experience indicates that a virtual meeting (e.g., via teleconference or Skype) prior to the first physical meeting helps in achieving working group goals. In addition, making real progress typically requires at least four full days of meeting time.

---------

The working group sessions will take place at the University of Regina's Field Station, located in the Center Block of Cypress Hills Inter-Provincial Park. This location was chosen for its centrality within Canada and presence within the ecosystem of interest: the Canadian prairies. 

Meetings will take place over May 8-12th, 2023; pre-meeting materials and logistical information will be circulated to all participants in early March, 2023, and a pre-session meeting with all participants will be scheduled the week of April 3rd-7th. 

**Pre-meeting materials and activities**

In early 2023, the organizers will collect and tidy all database components. This will ensure that working group hours can be spent focused on achieving milestones and generating scientific insight. Over January and February 2023, organizers will select pre-meeting readings to be circulated to all participants in March, and plan/develop the introductory presentation and meeting taking place in early April. In this introductory gathering, to be held over Zoom or an equivalent virtual conferencing platform, organizers will provide a general introduction to themselves and the project, share the daily schedule for the upcoming Working Group meetings, and communicate any actions that participants must take prior to the in-person meeting. A code of conduct will also be developed and shared at this gathering, which will be covered again during the first day of the working group sessions. Participants will be asked to develop a short (~15 minute) introductory presentation to themselves and their work, also to be share on the first day of the upcoming meeting.

**Daily schedule and meeting agendas**

_Monday, May 8th, 2023_

Working group participants will present their short talks and field questions in the morning. The organizers will end the morning session with a joint presentation. All organizers will describe the topic and goals of the working group, and a code of conduct will be established for the optimal run of the diverse, equitable, and inclusive working group, including a discussion on how we will use and handle the data coming from underrepresented areas and collaborators.
Finally, the working group will address the question of “How we can predict raptor responses to climate change in the prairies and their responses to ecosystem restoration?”, by brainstorming solution ideas in the frame of their area of expertise. Teams will be formed to focus on specific tasks taking advantage of their expertise.

_Tuesday, May 9th, 2023_

During the morning each group will work on finishng their tasks and during the afternoon groups will be shuffled  and make a quick presentation of their work done, to discuss and collect multidivertse feedback to draft a final proposal of their particular tasks.

_Wednesday, May 10th, 2023_

The working groups will finalize their tasks and present their progress during the morning, they will recive target feedback to have an amalgamation of ideas and identification of missing pieces. Finally, there will be an afternon retreat with the hope to see the raptors.

_Thursday, May 11th, 2023_

work at  in breakout groups (perhaps larger groups of 5 this time?)
Lareger working groups will be fomred (5 individuals) to assign leadership roles to accomplish every single left task and discuss and solve the remaining unsolved parts of the assaingments.  

_Friday, May 12th, 2023_

The final progress will be presented to then discuss the rough manuscript structure and  talk about future directions of the living data project and stablish a detailed plan schedule will be created that establishes a critical route plan to achieve the goal outcomes, including meetings and zoom follow-ups. 

**Follow-up activities and milestones**

Follow-up meetings, pending approval/agreement during the last day of working-group meetings, will take place biweekly. In these meetings progress updates will be requested from participants on their respective tasks (e.g., manuscript drafting, coding and data analysis, non-academic communications). Our tentative goal for submission of the working group's key outcome, a journal article describing the model developed and predictions made by the working group, is by the end of August 2023 (roughly three months after the end of the working group meetings).
