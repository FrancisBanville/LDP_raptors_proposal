Expected outcomes (e.g., publications, white papers, open access databases, etc).

//

The key expected outcomes from this working group include the publication of a paper in the scientific literature. This publication will make use of data extracted from the literature, and will include any analysis-code produced and used by the working group to improve the understanding of raptor responses to climate and ecosystem change in the prairies. Making all this information public and available for different research objectives in a permanent repository and in an R package, through GitHub, will be a key priority for the working group.
