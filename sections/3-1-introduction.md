Brief introduction to the project goals.

Since European colonization, the Canadian prairies have undergone significant environmental changes. Hunting and trapping removed keystone species, such as the Plains Bison (Bison bison bison), 80% of prairie land was converted for agriculture, and the remaining native prairie was degraded from intensive cattle grazing (Roch & Jaeger. 2014; Samson & Knopf. 1994). Modern land use practices (e.g., Oil and natural gas extraction and urbanization) and climate change continue to alter the prairie environment, resulting in changes to species abundance and distributions and (species at risk). 






•	Many ongoing conservations and restoration projects (Grassland national park, South of the Divide, Greater-sage Grouse and Burrowing Owl reintroduction programs)
•	Monitoring the continued changes due to human land use and climate change and the changes occurring due to restoration efforts ()
•	Raptors are used as indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem health. Are good (Bildstein, 2001; Withaningsih et al. 2019)
•	Buteo (Hawks) (three main species: Red-tailed Hawk (Generalist), Swainson’s Hawk (Grassland specialist; population stable), Ferruginous Hawk (Grassland specialist; conservation concern)
•	Provide species distra
