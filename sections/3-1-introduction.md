Brief introduction to the project goals.

Since European colonization, the Canadian prairies have undergone significant environmental changes. (1) Hunting and trapping removed keystone species, such as the Plains Bison (Bison bison bison), (2) 80% of the prairie was converted to agriculture, and (3) the remaining native prairie was degraded due to intensive cattle grazing (Roch & Jaeger. 2014; Samson & Knopf. 1994). Modern land use practices (e.g., Oil and natural gas extraction and urbanization) and climate change continue to alter the prairie environment, resulting in changes to native and non-native species abundance and distributions. Due to the historic and modern patchwork of land use practices within the prairies, the land is distributed amongst Federal, Provincial, public and private quarter sections that, often results in habitat restoration and species-at-risk management projects being conducted on a small local scale with no standardized methods for monitoring success within the landscape scale.


Monitoring raptor distribution and abundance is an efficient, manageable and reproducible method to indicate the biodiversity and ecosystem health within the landscape scale (Bildstein, 2001; Withaningsih et al. 2019). It is generally accepted that raptors, native grassland specialists and generalists within the Buteo genus, will positively respond to grassland restoration projects and, therefore, be an ideal focal group for monitoring changes within broadscale communities (Slankard et al. 2018).  There are three species of hawks within the Buteo genus that breed Within Prairie Canada. The Red-tailed Hawk, a generalist species, the Swanson’s Hawk, a grasslands specialist with a stable population and the Ferruginous Hawk, a Grassland specialist, recently upgraded to a species of conservation concern.


•	Decades of date: Hawk watch, Christmas Bird counts, Government and research project databases, ebird, in naturalist, Citizen Science reports.
•	Extensive environmental datasets available within the region (Environment Canada, Privet companies (e.g. Saskpower,) agro Canada…)
•	Increased predation risk is one of the leading causes of risk to endangered species in the prairies.  Increased Predation Pressure to many species. (Environment Canada).  Corresponds with existing projects
