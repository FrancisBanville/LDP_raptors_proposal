Brief introduction to the project goals.

Since European colonization, the Canadian prairies have undergone significant environmental changes. (1) Hunting and trapping removed keystone species, such as the Plains Bison (Bison bison bison), (2) 80% of prairie land was converted for agriculture, and (3) the remaining native prairie was degraded due to intensive cattle grazing (Roch & Jaeger. 2014; Samson & Knopf. 1994). Modern land use practices (e.g., Oil and natural gas extraction and urbanization) and climate change continue to alter the prairie environment, resulting in changes to native and non-native species abundance and distributions. Due to the historic and modern patchwork of land use practices within the prairies, the land is distributed amongst Federal, Provincial, public and private quarter sections that, often results in habitat restoration and species-at-risk management projects being conducted on a small local scale with no standardized methods for monitoring success within the landscape scale.


Monitoring raptor distribution and abundance is an efficient, manageable and reproducible method to indicate the biodiversity and ecosystem health within the landscape scale (Bildstein, 2001; Withaningsih et al. 2019). It is generally accepted that raptors, native grassland specialists and generalists within the Buteo genus, will positively respond to grassland restoration projects (Slankard et al. 2018)……
