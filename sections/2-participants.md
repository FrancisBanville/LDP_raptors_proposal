A list of participants, with affiliations and a short (one paragraph) biographic profile including description of their expertise contributed to the working group. Productive working groups typically include participants from a variety of career stages, including early career researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows) as well as mid to later-career researchers (e.g. university faculty, government research scientists, senior managers). CIEE is a national organization, and therefore encourages geographic breadth of the Canadian participants.. Finally, please distinguish between those who have committed to the project and those who are potential participants.
