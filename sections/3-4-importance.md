Importance to Canada (e.g., benefit to Canadian environmental and economic well-being).

Cultural significance

Beyond their important ecological roles, hawks have long served as significant figures in the cultures and lives of several indigenous groups, who have inhabited their lands since time immemorial. For example, nations who reside on the prairies use hawk skins in ceremonial medicinal bundles, and several indigenous groups value hawk feathers very highly [1]. First Nations individuals in Canada have also described having personal relationships with hawks as pets [2].

Indeed, as with many animal species that they lived, and now live, alongside, indigenous people have developed a close and culturally-significant relationship with hawks. Modern-day developments and an increasingly flippant climate will impact these long-standing relationships; one goal of this working group is to predict these impacts, using western scientific methodology and perspective.

*Ecological Importance*

Hawks naturally provide a vital ecological service as an apex avian predator. They regulate small mammal populations, including Deer Mice and Richard’s Ground Squirrels, both species that are considered pests. 

The distribution and abundance maps created by this working group project will greatly impact existing habitat restoration and species-at-risk management projects within Prairie, Canada. 

Provide a base for measuring the success of past and present restoration projects and how different land use practices and Climate Change parameters like (temperature and rainfall) will affect the effectiveness of different restoration methods, allowing government, private and non-profit organizations to make more informed decisions that allow for more effective land management to occur. 

*Scientific Importance*

Contribute to provincial, federal and academic research. 

Inform endangered species management projects

Provide a Pilate project for similar predictive models 

*Economic Importance*

Provide Federal and provincial government, Non-profit environmental organizations and other environmental groups information that can be used to inform future habitat restoration and species management projects

Land trust organization’s information on land purchasing investments to target high-quality land for protections

Oil, natural gas, and power companies can make more informed decisions on areas infrastructure will have fewer impacts to build.
