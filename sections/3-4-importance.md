Importance to Canada (e.g., benefit to Canadian environmental and economic well-being).

Cultural significance

Beyond their important ecological roles, hawks have long served as significant figures in the cultures and lives of several indigenous groups, who have inhabited their lands since time immemorial. For example, nations who reside on the prairies use hawk skins in ceremonial medicinal bundles, and several indigenous groups value hawk feathers very highly [1]. First Nations individuals in Canada have also described having personal relationships with hawks as pets [2].

Indeed, as with many animal species that they lived, and now live, alongside, indigenous people have developed a close and culturally-significant relationship with hawks. Modern-day developments and an increasingly flippant climate will impact these long-standing relationships; one goal of this working group is to predict these impacts, using western scientific methodology and perspective.
