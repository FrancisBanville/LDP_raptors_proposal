Importance to Canada (e.g., benefit to Canadian environmental and economic well-being).

Cultural significance

Beyond their important ecological roles, hawks have long served as significant figures in the cultures and lives of several Indigenous groups, who have inhabited their lands since time immemorial. For example, nations who reside on the prairies use hawk skins in ceremonial medicinal bundles, and several indigenous groups value hawk feathers very highly (Kuhnlein and Humphries, 2017). First Nations individuals in Canada have also described having closer and more personal relationships with hawks, for example, keeping them as pets (Rempel, 2019).

Indeed, as with many animal species that they lived, and now live, alongside, Indigenous people have developed a close and culturally-significant relationship with hawks. Modern-day developments and an increasingly flippant climate will impact these long-standing relationships; one goal of this working group is to predict these impacts, using western scientific methodology and perspective.   



*Ecological Importance*

The Swainson's, Red-tailed, and Ferruginous hawks are apex avian predators that provide vital ecological services by regulating small mammal populations.  Hawks require accessibility to prey and will utilize the landscape in areas where prey is most abundant, indicating areas that support small mammal populations. 

one goal of this working group is to create a distribution and abundance map of the three Buteo hawks within the Mixed-grass prairies of Canada. This map will be openly accessible for current and future habitat restoration and species-at-risk management projects, including Park’s Canada’s ongoing management of Black-tailed Prairie Dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and Greater-sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and the conditioned monitoring of the Ferruginous hawk by Environment Canada. 

The working group aims to create a predictive model of hawks’ responses to climate and ecosystem changes in the prairies and would provide a base for measuring the success of past and present restoration projects and how different land use practices and Climate Change parameters like (temperature and rainfall) will affect the effectiveness of different restoration methods, allowing government, private and non-profit organizations to make more informed decisions that allow for more effective land management to occur.

*Economic Importance*

The raptor distribution map and predictive model will provide interested parties with an additional tool for informing future projects. Habitat restoration and species management projects can save time and money on preliminary field surveys, allowing more decisive management decisions.  Parties conducting land acquisition can make more informed purchasing decisions based on their needs within a landscape scale, such as land trust organization’s targeting environmentally viable land. In contrast, large industrial companies can make more informed decisions on areas where infrastructure will have fewer environmental impacts.
